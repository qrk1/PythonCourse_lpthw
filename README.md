# PythonCourse_lpthw

This is the repository for the JagTech Python course based on lpthw. Students will first purchase the text and then follow along as directed in the assignments distributed in the Github Classroom repository. 

For the 2018, the course will begin as a summer assignment (Exercise 0 to 39). The rest of the course will continue in the fall.
